UPDATE MILESTONE 5
------------------

With the inclusion of Maven in this milestone, I am no longer to keep my repository
in my workspace because it corrups the .git folder. Because of this, I've been required
to recreate the git repository entirely and no longer have pre-milestone 5 commits.
I have saved the old version of my project locally, but for right now, GitHub will only
have my post milestone 4 commits.

Maven has also caused a lot of problems trying to move my project back and forth between
PCs. Before I could save my project and server on a USB and then easily switch from my
laptop to my desktop and vice versa. Now every time I switch the usb over, I have atleast
1 corrupted file and I need to recreate the server every time. This isn't that big of a
deal, but still a pain and I feel could lead to eventual project corruption. To combat this,
I will continue pushing my project to GitHub with every little update.
